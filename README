---- ArchByte ----
A minimalist, yet elegant configuration and theme for the awesome window manager on Arch Linux.

awesome window manager: http://awesome.naquadah.org


DESCRIPTION:
    Although I consider myself to be a power user, ArchByte is created with the 
    average Linux user in mind. My goal is for both the power user and average user to feel right at home.

DEPENDENCIES:
    - vicious (http://git.sysphere.org/vicious/)
    - eminent (http://git.glacicle.org/eminent)
        - or you can just delete the line in rc.lua that says require("eminent")
    - git (for installation)

INSTALLATION:
    - if the awesome window manager is not in your distribution's repositories, you can find several
      package formats and the source code on awesome's website (linked above).
    - once awesome is installed, create a directory in your home folder called .config/awesome
      (if .config does not already exist, it will have to be created first)
    - to install ArchByte, enter the following commands in a terminal:
        cd %HOME/.config/awesome
        git clone git://github.com/slackbyte/ArchByte.git
    - if awesome is currently running, it will have to be restarted (shortcut: Mod4+CTRL+r)
    - celebrate your success in installing ArchByte in whatever way you are accustomed

CHANGE LOG:
    - changed the style of most widgets (inspired by xeNULL http://xenull.blogspot.com/)
    - cleaned up widget grouping in favor of modularity
    - temporarily disabled volume widget due to some issues I'm having (hopefully will be fixed soon)
    - added mouse-over calender to clock widget (using the example on the awesome wiki)
    - cleaned up color variables in archlinux/theme.lua
    - added a useful "pangoify" function to clean up inserting pango markup into strings

TODO (in order of priority):
    - fix volume widget
    - change font
    - add mouse-over tooltips to widgets (possibly using naughty)
        - mousing over CPU widget will display a list of the status of all individual cpus
        - mousing over BAT widget will display estimated time left and current state
        - more is planned and even more will be created
    - add naughty support
        - integrate common applications with naughty
    - much more is constantly being added! If you have an idea, don't hesitate to suggest it!


Suggestions are always more than welcome! If you are having issues, as always google is your friend
and mine. But if that is somehow unsuccessful, I am willing to attempt to help you in any way I can,
though I maintain that I am not responsible for any problems that result from you choosing to use
this configuration or theme.
