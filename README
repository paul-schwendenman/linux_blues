---- ArchByte ----
A minimalist, yet elegant configuration and theme for the awesome window manager on Arch Linux.

awesome window manager: http://awesome.naquadah.org


DESCRIPTION:
    Although I consider myself to be a power user, ArchByte is created with the average Linux
    user in mind. My goal is for both the power user and average user to feel right at home.

FEATURES:
    - Clean, minimal interface
    - Dynamic widgets
        - Color feedback to reflect current state
        - Mouse over to reveal more information
    - Support for dynamic control of window transparency
    - I am constantly adding things when I have more ideas and I am very open to suggestions!

CUSTOM KEYBOAD SHORTCUTS:
    - modkey + i
        launches default browser (requires $BROWSER to be defined)
    - modkey + Shift + i
        launches secondary browser (requires $BROWSER2 to be defined)
    - modkey + Control + r
        restart awesome (remapped from modkey+Shift+r)
    - modkey + Shift + r
        redraw focused client (remapped from modkey+Control+r)
    - modkey + b
        hide top and bottom wiboxes (status bars)
    - modkey + Shift + m
        moves mouse to bottom right corner for mouseless working
    - modkey + [
        decrease focused client's opacity
    - modkey + ]
        increase focused client's opacity
    - modkey + Shift + [
        set focused client's opacity to the minimum (shortcut)
    - modkey + Shift + ]
        set focused client's opacity to the maximum (shortcut)
    - Print Screen takes a screenshot and saves it in /tmp

DEPENDENCIES:
    - vicious (http://git.sysphere.org/vicious/)
    - eminent (http://git.glacicle.org/eminent)
        - or you can just delete the line in rc.lua that says require("eminent")
    - [OPTIONAL] xcompmgr for window transparency support
        - xcompmgr is available in the "extra" Arch repository
        - also, you will need to run it at startup by adding "xcompmgr &" to your 
          xinitrc file before the line "exec awesome"
          - your xinitrc file can usually be found at either ~/.xinitrc or /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc

INSTALLATION:
    - you can download awesome from the Arch User Repository (AUR), or you can find several
      package formats and the source code on awesome's website (linked above).
    - once awesome is installed, create a directory in your home folder called .config/awesome
      (if .config does not already exist, it will have to be created first)
    - to install ArchByte, enter the following commands in a terminal:
        cd $HOME/.config/awesome
        git clone git://github.com/slackbyte/ArchByte.git
    - if awesome is currently running, it will have to be restarted (shortcut: Mod4+Shift+r)
    - celebrate your success in installing ArchByte in whatever way you are accustomed

TODO (in order of priority):
    - fix volume widget being a step behind when pulseaudio is installed
    - change font (roboto?)
    - add mouse-over tooltips to widgets (possibly using naughty) [WIP]
        - mousing over CPU widget will display a list of the status of all individual cpus
        - more is planned and even more will be created
    - add naughty support [WIP]
        - integrate common applications with naughty through dbus
    - much more is constantly being added! If you have an idea, don't hesitate to suggest it!


Suggestions are always more than welcome! If you are having issues, as always google is your friend
and mine. But if that is somehow unsuccessful, I am willing to attempt to help you in any way I can,
though I maintain that I am not responsible for any problems that result from you choosing to use
this configuration or theme.
