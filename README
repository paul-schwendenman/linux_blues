---- linux_blues ----
A minimalist, yet elegant configuration and theme for the awesome window manager (version 3.5).

awesome window manager: http://awesome.naquadah.org


DESCRIPTION:
    Although I consider myself to be a power user, linux_blues is created with the average Linux
    user in mind. My goal is for both the power user and average user to feel right at home.

FEATURES:
    - Clean, minimal interface
    - Dynamic widgets
        - Color feedback to reflect current state
        - Mouse over to reveal more information
    - Support for dynamic control of window transparency
    - I am constantly adding things when I have more ideas and I am very open to suggestions!

CUSTOM KEYBOAD SHORTCUTS:
    - modkey + i
        launches default browser (requires $BROWSER to be defined)
    - modkey + Shift + i
        launches secondary browser (requires $BROWSER2 to be defined)
    - modkey + Control + r
        restart awesome (remapped from modkey+Shift+r)

    - modkey + Shift + ]

    - Print Screen takes a screenshot and saves it in /tmp

DEPENDENCIES:
    - vicious (http://git.sysphere.org/vicious/)
    - eminent (http://git.glacicle.org/eminent)
        - or you can just delete the line in rc.lua that says
            eminent = require("eminent")
    - [OPTIONAL] xcompmgr for window transparency support
        - also, you will need to run it at startup by adding "xcompmgr &" to your 
          xinitrc file before the line "exec awesome"
          - your xinitrc file can usually be found at either ~/.xinitrc or /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc

INSTALLATION:
    - awesome can be found in most distribution repositories, and the source can be found on the
      website (linked above)
    - once awesome is installed, create a directory in your home folder called .config/awesome
      (if .config does not already exist, it will have to be created first)
    - to install linux_blues, enter the following commands in a terminal:
        cd $HOME/.config/awesome
        git clone git://github.com/slackbyte/linux_blues.git
    - if awesome is currently running, it will have to be restarted (shortcut: Mod4+Shift+r)
    - celebrate your success in installing linux_blues in whatever way you are accustomed


Suggestions are always more than welcome! If you are having issues, as always google is your friend
and mine. But if that is somehow unsuccessful, I am willing to attempt to help you in any way I can,
though I maintain that I am not responsible for any problems that result from you choosing to use
this configuration or theme.
